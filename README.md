# Car_Price_Pred

Project is based on the Case Study - “Predicting Automobile prices using Neural Networks.”
This project's aim is to create a model that can predict price of an automobile. The model takes into consideration the factors which are valued by the customers. 

We tried to answer the following questions in our analysis:

(1) After your EDA, what factors do you think influence a customer’s decision to buy a care? What are the objectives of the model that Farid plans to build?
(2) Construct a neural network model. Validate and interpret the model using a different number of hidden neurons.
(3) Compare your neural network models with linear regression model. Which one is better?

Auto	- Automatic (Yes=1, No=0)

CC	- Cylinder volume in cubic centimeters
 
Drs	- Number of doors

Cyl	- Number of cylinders

Grs	- Number of gear positions

Wght	- Weight in kilograms

G_P	- Guarantee period in months

Mfr_G	- Within manufacturer's guarantee period (Yes=1, No=0)

ABS	- Anti-lock brake system (Yes=1, No=0)

Abag_1	- Driver airbag (Yes=1, No=0)

Abag_2	- Passenger airbag (Yes=1, No=0)

AC	- Automatic air conditioning (Yes=1, No=0)

Comp	- Board computer (Yes=1, No=0)

CD	- CD player (Yes=1, No=0)

Clock -	Central lock (Yes=1, No=0)

Pwin	- Powered windows (Yes=1, No=0)

PStr	- Power steering (Yes=1, No=0)
