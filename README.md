# Car_Price_Pred

Project is based on the Case Study - “Predicting Automobile prices using Neural Networks.”
This project's aim is to create a model that can predict price of an automobile. The model takes into consideration the factors which are valued by the customers. 
Below are the variables considered for this model:

Price	- Offer price in CA$
Age	- Age in months
KM	- Accumulated kilometers on odometer
Fuel -	Fuel type (Petrol, Diesel, CNG)
HP- 	Horse power
MC	- Metallic colour? (Yes=1, No=0)
Colour -	Colour (blue, red, grey, silver, black, etc.)
Auto	- Automatic (Yes=1, No=0)
CC	- Cylinder volume in cubic centimeters
Drs	- Number of doors
Cyl	- Number of cylinders
Grs	- Number of gear positions
Wght	- Weight in kilograms
G_P	- Guarantee period in months
Mfr_G	- Within manufacturer's guarantee period (Yes=1, No=0)
ABS	- Anti-lock brake system (Yes=1, No=0)
Abag_1	- Driver airbag (Yes=1, No=0)
Abag_2	- Passenger airbag (Yes=1, No=0)
AC	- Automatic air conditioning (Yes=1, No=0)
Comp	- Board computer (Yes=1, No=0)
CD	- CD player (Yes=1, No=0)
Clock -	Central lock (Yes=1, No=0)
Pwin	- Powered windows (Yes=1, No=0)
PStr	- Power steering (Yes=1, No=0)
Radio	- Radio (Yes=1, No=0)
SpM	- Sport model (Yes=1, No=0)
M_Rim	- Metallic rim (Yes=1, No=0)
Tow_Bar	- Tow bar (Yes=1, No=0)

We tried to answer the following questions in our analysis:

(1) After your EDA, what factors do you think influence a customer’s decision to buy a care? What are the objectives of the model that Farid plans to build?
(2) Construct a neural network model. Validate and interpret the model using a different number of hidden neurons.
(3) Compare your neural network models with linear regression model. Which one is better?

Please refer to the final solution doc for our complete analysis. This assignment is done in R markdown.
